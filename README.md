# Customer Churn Analysis (Telecom)

## Overview
This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset using
exploratory data analysis and feature engineering techniques.
The goal is to identify key customer segments that are more likely to churn.

## Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset
- Records: 7,032 customers
- Features: Demographics, service usage, billing, and contract information

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data cleaning and type conversion
- Feature engineering (tenure bands, contract segmentation)
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Churn rate analysis across customer segments

## Key Insights
- Early-tenure customers show significantly higher churn rates.
- Month-to-month contracts are strongly associated with churn.
- Higher monthly charges increase churn likelihood.
- Long-term contracts improve customer retention.

## Visualizations
The project includes 11 visualizations such as histograms, box plots,
and heatmaps to support churn-related insights.

## Future Work
- Build a churn prediction model using machine learning
- Perform feature importance analysis
- Evaluate retention strategies based on churn drivers
